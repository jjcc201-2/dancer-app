# Dancer App

The idea of this application is to create a dummy application that will be used to teach the basics of Node.js and Express.js. The application will allow for simple CRUD operations on a database of dancers. The application will be built in a step by step fashion, with each step being a branch in the repository. The steps will be as follows:

1. Create a basic Node.js application
2. Create a basic Express.js application
3. Create a basic Express.js application with a database
4. Create a basic Express.js application with a database and a view engine
